Map Visualisation
===================


The Map can be visualised to see the spatial expansion of the Farmers. 

.. Hint:: By setting ``save_gif == True`` in the model ``parameters``, a gif is automatically generated and stored in the ``images`` folder.

Implementation
--------------

.. automodule:: map_presenter

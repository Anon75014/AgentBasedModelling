Graph Visualisation
===================


Graphs are used to visualise interesting Farmer parameters. 

.. Note:: During the AgentPy simulation properties are stored internally with ``record()`` functions during the ``update()`` calls. Once the simulation has ended, the results are handed over to the ``graph_presenter`` which then visualises them.


Implementation
--------------

.. automodule:: graph_presenter

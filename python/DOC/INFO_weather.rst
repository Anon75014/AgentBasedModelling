River Description
==================

The central river of the map (blue line of cells) is used to model the water supply. 
In the current version of the model, the river flows from left to right. 
Depending on how much water the leftmost farmer needs, the river content decreases for the next one. 
Farmers can only take as much water as they need, but if it does not suffice to curate all the crops, he gets smaller harvest.

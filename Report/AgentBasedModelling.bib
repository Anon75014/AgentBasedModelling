	abstract = {Farm level scale policy analysis is receiving increased attention due to a changing agricultural policy orientation. Agent based models (ABM) are farm level models that have appeared in the end of 1990's, having several differences from traditional farm level models, like the consideration of interactions between farms, the way markets are simulated, the inclusion of agents' bounded rationality, behavioral heterogeneity, etc. Considering the potential of ABMs to complement existing farm level models and that they are a relatively recent approach with a growing demand for new models and modelers, we perform a systematic literature review to (a) consolidate in a consistent and transparent way the literature status on policy evaluation ABMs; (b) examine the status of the literature regarding model transparency; the modeling of the agents' decision processes; and the creation of the initial population.},

	title = {Agricultural policies and farm structures - {Agent}-based modelling and application to {EU}-policy reform},
	abstract = {The development of competitive and efficient agricultural structures has been one of the central goals of agricultural policy making in addition to ensuring a fair standard of living for farmers. To achieve these goals, the agricultural sector in most industrialised nations has long been the subject of government interven-tions. However, many agricultural policies have worked counteractively to these goals by creating distortions in the use of resources. Against this background, the emergence of new and innovative modelling methods such as agent-based models, in addition to ever-increasing computing capacities has offered new possibilities to model adjustment reactions and to quantify the impact of agri-cultural policies.This thesis takes up these new methodologies and applies them to the modelling and evaluation of agricultural policy impacts on regional structural change in Baden-Württemberg. The thesis contributes to a deeper understanding of struc-tural change dynamics and factors causing structural change. The starting point of the analysis is the hypothesis that Hohenlohe's agricultural structure displays structural inefficiencies and that structural adjustment in the past has been im-peded by existing agricultural policies. Based on these assumptions, it is studied whether and to what extent policy changes can facilitate structural adjustment towards a more efficient and competitive agricultural structure},

	abstract = {Water resource allocation is the process of assessing and determining a mechanism on how water should be distributed among different regions, sectors and users. Over the recent decades, the optimal solution for water resource allocation has been explored both in centralised and decentralised mechanisms. Conventional approaches are under central planner suggesting a solution which maximises total welfare to the users. Moving towards the decentralised modelling, the techniques consider individuals as if they act selﬁshly in their own favour. While central planner provides an efﬁcient solution, it may not be acceptable for some selﬁsh agents. The contrary is true as well in decentralised solution, where the solution lacks efﬁciency leading to an inefﬁcient usage of provided resources. This paper develops a parallel evolutionary search algorithm to introduce a mechanism in re-distributing the central planner revenue value among the competing agents based on their contribution to the central solution. The result maintains the efﬁciency and is used as an incentive for calculating a fair revenue for each agent. The framework is demonstrated and discussed to allocate water resources along the Nile river basin, where there exist eleven competing users represented as agents in various sectors with upstream-downstream relationships and different water demands and availability.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is the largest consumer of water. Since water demand for irrigational purposes is expected to rise and given the fact that freshwater is not an unlimited resource, conflicts about the use of water and allocation issues are becoming more intense. The present paper examines the potential for water conflict when water consumption for irrigation takes place. In order to contribute to the discussion on this issue, game theory is used as a platform that provides predictions about strategies of irrigation followed by stakeholders. Previously published research work on game theory applications analyzing agricultural water rights is reviewed. The paper also discusses the nature and characteristics of selected games. The goal of this article is to highlight the evolution of game theory application in irrigation and contribute to the discussion about resolving resource conflicts generated by irrigated agriculture. The results of this analysis may be appreciated by policy makers for creative problem solving about water use in the field of irrigation management.},

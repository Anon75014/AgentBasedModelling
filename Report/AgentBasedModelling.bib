	abstract = {Farm level scale policy analysis is receiving increased attention due to a changing agricultural policy orientation. Agent based models (ABM) are farm level models that have appeared in the end of 1990's, having several differences from traditional farm level models, like the consideration of interactions between farms, the way markets are simulated, the inclusion of agents' bounded rationality, behavioral heterogeneity, etc. Considering the potential of ABMs to complement existing farm level models and that they are a relatively recent approach with a growing demand for new models and modelers, we perform a systematic literature review to (a) consolidate in a consistent and transparent way the literature status on policy evaluation ABMs; (b) examine the status of the literature regarding model transparency; the modeling of the agents' decision processes; and the creation of the initial population.},

	title = {Agricultural policies and farm structures - {Agent}-based modelling and application to {EU}-policy reform},
	abstract = {The development of competitive and efficient agricultural structures has been one of the central goals of agricultural policy making in addition to ensuring a fair standard of living for farmers. To achieve these goals, the agricultural sector in most industrialised nations has long been the subject of government interven-tions. However, many agricultural policies have worked counteractively to these goals by creating distortions in the use of resources. Against this background, the emergence of new and innovative modelling methods such as agent-based models, in addition to ever-increasing computing capacities has offered new possibilities to model adjustment reactions and to quantify the impact of agri-cultural policies.This thesis takes up these new methodologies and applies them to the modelling and evaluation of agricultural policy impacts on regional structural change in Baden-Württemberg. The thesis contributes to a deeper understanding of struc-tural change dynamics and factors causing structural change. The starting point of the analysis is the hypothesis that Hohenlohe's agricultural structure displays structural inefficiencies and that structural adjustment in the past has been im-peded by existing agricultural policies. Based on these assumptions, it is studied whether and to what extent policy changes can facilitate structural adjustment towards a more efficient and competitive agricultural structure},

	abstract = {Water resource allocation is the process of assessing and determining a mechanism on how water should be distributed among different regions, sectors and users. Over the recent decades, the optimal solution for water resource allocation has been explored both in centralised and decentralised mechanisms. Conventional approaches are under central planner suggesting a solution which maximises total welfare to the users. Moving towards the decentralised modelling, the techniques consider individuals as if they act selﬁshly in their own favour. While central planner provides an efﬁcient solution, it may not be acceptable for some selﬁsh agents. The contrary is true as well in decentralised solution, where the solution lacks efﬁciency leading to an inefﬁcient usage of provided resources. This paper develops a parallel evolutionary search algorithm to introduce a mechanism in re-distributing the central planner revenue value among the competing agents based on their contribution to the central solution. The result maintains the efﬁciency and is used as an incentive for calculating a fair revenue for each agent. The framework is demonstrated and discussed to allocate water resources along the Nile river basin, where there exist eleven competing users represented as agents in various sectors with upstream-downstream relationships and different water demands and availability.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is the largest consumer of water. Since water demand for irrigational purposes is expected to rise and given the fact that freshwater is not an unlimited resource, conflicts about the use of water and allocation issues are becoming more intense. The present paper examines the potential for water conflict when water consumption for irrigation takes place. In order to contribute to the discussion on this issue, game theory is used as a platform that provides predictions about strategies of irrigation followed by stakeholders. Previously published research work on game theory applications analyzing agricultural water rights is reviewed. The paper also discusses the nature and characteristics of selected games. The goal of this article is to highlight the evolution of game theory application in irrigation and contribute to the discussion about resolving resource conflicts generated by irrigated agriculture. The results of this analysis may be appreciated by policy makers for creative problem solving about water use in the field of irrigation management.},

ABSTRACT = {This study examines the water productivity of irrigated wheat and maize yields in Karkheh River Basin (KRB) in the semi-arid region of Iran using a coupled modeling approach consisting of the hydrological model (SWAT) and the river basin water allocation model (MODSIM). Dynamic irrigation requirements instead of constant time series of demand were considered. As the cereal production of KRB plays a major role in supplying the food market of Iran, it is necessary to understand the crop yield-water relations for irrigated wheat and maize in the lower part of KRB (LKRB) where most of the irrigated agricultural plains are located. Irrigated wheat and maize yields (Y) and consumptive water use (AET) were modeled with uncertainty analysis at a subbasin level for 1990–2010. Simulated Y and AET were used to calculate crop water productivity (CWP). The coupled SWAT–MODSIM approach improved the accuracy of SWAT outputs by considering the water allocation derived from MODSIM. The results indicated that the highest CWP across this region was 1.31 kg·m−3 and 1.13 kg·m−3 for wheat and maize, respectively; and the lowest was less than 0.62 kg·m−3 and 0.58 kg·m−3. A close linear relationship was found for CWP and yield. The results showed a continuing increase for AET over the years while CWP peaks and then declines. This is evidence of the existence of a plateau in CWP as AET continues to increase and evidence of the fact that higher AET does not necessarily result in a higher yield.},

abstract = {The water-use characteristics of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) were studied in the field under furrow irrigation. Irrigation water quantities were based on pan evaporation (Epan) from a screened class-A pan. Treatments consisted of three irrigation intervals (I1: 7 days; I2: 14 days, I3: 21 days), and four pan coefficients (Kcp1: 0.60; Kcp2: 0.80, Kcp3: 1.00 and Kcp4: 1.20). Average irrigation values for each treatment varied from 467 to 857mm in 2003 and 398 to 654mm in 2004. The highest seasonal evapotranspiration was obtained from the I3Kcp4 treatment in 2004 (1019mm); the lowest value was observed in the I1Kcp1 treatment in the same year (598.0mm). Data collected in 2003 and 2004 showed that the amount of irrigation water applied significantly the affected seed yield. However, the effects of irrigation interval on yield were not significant. On average, the Kcp3 treatment gave the highest seed yield (1.915tha−1), whereas Kcp1 treatment gave the lowest (1.538tha−1). Seasonal yield response factors (ky) were 1.01 and 0.54 in 2003 and 2004, respectively. ET/Epan ratios for each treatment varied from 0.3 to 1.3 in 2003 and from 0.1 to 1.1 in 2004. In conclusion, the Kcp3 plant-pan coefficient is recommended for sesame grown under field conditions in order to maximise yield.}

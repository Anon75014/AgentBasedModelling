% COMMANDS: 
	% To do anything in LaTeX, you must use commands
	% Commands tell LaTeX when to start your document, how you want your document to look, and how to format your document
	% Commands ALWAYS begin with a backslash \

% Everything following the % sign is a comment and will not be used by Latex to compile your document.
% This is very similar to # comments in R.

% Every .tex file usually consists of four parts.
% 1. Document Class
% 2. Packages
% 3. Header
% 4. Your Document
 
\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article} % This defines the style of your paper

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 2. Packages
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Packages are libraries of commands that LaTeX can call when compiling the document. With the specialized commands you can customize the formatting of your document.
% If the packages we call are not installed yet, TeXworks will ask you to install the necessary packages while compiling.

% First, we usually want to set the margins of our document. For this we use the package geometry. We call the package with the \usepackage command. The package goes in the {}, the parameters again go into the [].
\usepackage[top = 2.5cm, bottom = 2.5cm, left = 2.5cm, right = 2.5cm]{geometry} 
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{tikz} %for the flow chart
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,arrows}
\usepackage{amsmath} %math package
\usepackage{amsmath, nccmath} %multiple fractions
\usepackage{pgfplots} %plots
\usepackage{pgfplotstable} %to plot from imported text files
\pgfplotsset{compat = newest}
\usepackage{subcaption} %figures with multiple captions
\usepackage{multirow} % Multirow is for tables with multiple rows within one cell.
\usepackage{booktabs} % For even nicer tables.
\usepackage{graphicx} %to include some plots (.pdf files) we need a package for that.
\usepackage[justification=centering]{caption} %Centering captions under the figures
\usepackage{setspace}
\setlength{\parindent}{0in} %The following command sets the indent to 0.
\usepackage{float} % Package to place figures where you want them.
\usepackage{fancyhdr} % to create nice headers.
\usepackage[numbered, framed]{mcode} %Package for Matlab code listings:
\lstset{stepnumber  = 5, % Line numbers go in steps of 4
	breaklines  = true,
	breakautoindent=true, 
	breakindent=10pt,
	breakatwhitespace   = false,
	prebreak= \space,
	postbreak   = \space}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 3. Header (and Footer)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\pagestyle{fancy} % % To make our document nice we want a header and number the pages in the footer. With this command we can customize the header style.
\fancyhf{} % This makes sure we do not have other information in our header or footer.
\lhead{\footnotesize Agent-based Modelling}% \lhead puts text in the top left corner. \footnotesize sets our font to a smaller size. \rhead works just like \lhead (you can also use \chead)
\rhead{\footnotesize Christopher Golling, Gael Mourouga, Author 3, Author 4, Author 5} %<---- Fill in your lastnames.
\cfoot{\footnotesize \thepage} % We want to put our page number in the center.

% 4. document

\thispagestyle{empty} % This command disables the header on the first page.

\section{Introduction}

Due to population growth, urbanization, and climate change, competition for water resources is expected to increase, with a particular impact on agriculture \footnote{https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water-in-agriculture}. \\
Consequently, both farmers and policymakers can benefit from farm-level models which optimise water usage and crop nature, based on a set of different externalities including water ressources availability and market dynamics.\\
The model featured in this coding project aims to illustrate the process behind the development of agent-based farm-level models, by starting with a simple, deterministic model that is progressively complexified with elements from physics-based models and game theory.


\section{State-of-the-Art}

To guide the development of our illustrative agent-based model, a literature review was conducted to assess the state-of-the-art on agent-based modelling for water ressources allocation and farming simulations. \\
A seed review paper was selected, "A review of Agent Based Modeling for agricultural policy evaluation" by Kremmydas et al.(2018) from which a literature graph was generated from online tools, and the result is presented on figure \ref{fig:State_of_the_art}.
